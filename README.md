 Multi-paradigm programming language (object orient, Procedural,
structural etc.)
 With the python interactive interpreter it is easy to check python
commands
 Platform independent

Python 2 V/S Python 3
 No backward Compatibility
 Division operator like C ////// Division Operator
 Print “hello’ ////// print(“hello”)
 Implicit str type is ASCII //////Implicit str type is UNICODE
Explicit Support for UNICODE
 range() & xrange() /////only range()
 Exception handling //// as keyword is required
 raw_input() for reading String /////only input() function exists
input() for reading data with filtering
